# American Express Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2023-2025 apprenticeship at American Express. This includes a 3 month bootcamp where we learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node, version control, and fundamental programming concepts, followed by on-the-job learning. The 4 projects ive chosen show competency in each area of software development, as well as skills to collaborate with other developers and provide good documentation. All of this provides a great starting point for my career.

## Overview of Apprenticeship

During my apprenticeship  Amex, I delivered value not only through improvements to my team's codebase but also by adding additional functionality. In this time I assisted in implementing a new component to the existing codebase, as well as, working on various user stories, epics, and bug fixes.

## Portfolio Introduction
Who Am I?
Hello, Im Kevin Dutzy, I am originally from Michigan but have relocated to Arizona as of 2023 to take a Software Engineering apprenticeship at American Express. Previously I worked in E-commerce but decided to make the transition into tech since ive always had an interest. I had some experience before the apprenticeship, I attended a bootcamp through Flatiron out of NY which provided a great starting point and network of people who were going through the same things I was. Outside of work i enjoy playing billiards, camping, hiking, thrifting, just about anything!
