## Frontend Project - Historic Art Archive

A front end application that utilizes a free API to fetch historic art via ```https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org```

### Situation<br>
The goal of this application is to work with an external API and build a UI that allows users to control the data they see as well as save art that they like. This app has features for accessibility in mind such as light/dark mode as well as a responsive view to any device. 

### Task
The team wanted to design a clean and intuitive UI that was easy to interact with.<br>
Part of my tasks was to create the design and logic for:
- [FavortieCard](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/FavoriteCard.jsx)
- [FavoriteList](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/FavoriteCard.jsx)
- [Header](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/Header.jsx)
- [Dark Mode](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/Header.jsx#L28-L34)
- Building the [App Root](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/App.jsx)
- Some contributions to the [ArtCard](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/ArtCard.jsx) for handling favorited items. 
- All of these files are housed in the [src](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Front%20End%20Project/src).

Our main focus for this project was to integrate an external API and build a UI around it that is intuitive to use, provides accessibility features for users, navigation, displays dynamic routes, and has some sort of filtering when it comes to the data being displayed.

### Action
There were several areas in the repo that contributed, I will go be discussing the components I built, as well as the logic for the favorite feature and app root
#### [Components](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components)
- ##### [App Root](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/App.jsx)
Here is where most of the high level configurations are set - like the design theme for the app
![SS1](./assets/SS1.png)
Or where a lot of the high level state is managed to be passed around and inital ```useEffect()``` is called to pull in the data
![SS2](./assets/SS2.png)
I also wrote the logic and to handle removing and adding favorites to your collection as well as the JSX to give the root level of the application

- ##### [ArtCard](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/ArtCard.jsx)
For the ArtCard I contributed by adding CSS for styling, as well as additional logic to handle adding/removing a favorited item
![SS5](./assets/SS5.png)

now to see what happens when you click to favorite an item

- ##### [FavortieList](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/FavoriteList.jsx)
when you click to favorite a piece of art, it gets stored in state as an array of ```favorites```. those are then mapped over and each favorite then returns a ```FavoriteCard``` which you would see as a list in ```/favorties``` route.
![SS8](./assets/SS8.png)
- ##### [FavortieCard](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Front%20End%20Project/src/components/FavoriteCard.jsx)
when FavoriteCard is called on each item, it returns this piece of JSX to be rendered in the list, populated with some data from the item.

##### Frontend View Favorite List:
![SS9](./assets/SS9.png)
##### Single Favorite Card:
![SS10](./assets/SS10.png)
- #### Logic for handling favorites
![SS11](./assets/SS11.png)
- you can see that ```removeFavorite``` takes a parameter of ```deleteArt``` which is the expected item to remove from the favorites list, so we filter over the favorites array to search for an object id that matches the one we passed in to the function, we then set the updated array as the new state and render it.
- for ```handleFavorites``` I first had to check whether or not that item already existed in the favorites array or not - because we cant have an item favorited twice. if the item comes back as being valid, we update the existing state to include the new item.

## Competencies
### 2.3 - Can develop effective user interfaces
- for this project the main focus was on building a clean and functional UI that is both responsive and accessible.
- Through utilizing standardized libraries such as [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/) I was able to build a more uniform components and intuitive layout for the user which in turn allows for a better UX
![SS4](./assets/SS4.png)
- from there I added the ability to toggle from light or dark mode - to add to accessibility for the web page 
![SS13](./assets/SS13.png)

### 2.5 - Can implement a responsive User Interface
- Through using MUI as well as CSS Flex, I built our application to be responsive regardless of the browser size or device.
- This allows more users to interact with the application as well as leads to an overall better UX.
- the use of Flex and its properties ```flexWrap``` allows the items to overflow within the FavortiesList component
![SS14](./assets/SS14.png)
### Example of Flex Wrap:
![SS15](./assets/SS15.png)
here you can see the list of favo



### JF 3.5 - Can apply algorithms, logic and data structures
- Creating the seed data i had to build a data structure to store the data, as well as utilizing algorithms such as ```.find()```, and logical operators for conditional statements
- for the seed data I created an Array, that would store n instruments.
![SS5](./assets/SS5.png)
- each object inside the array would be one instrument, with all the necessary data needed
- in order to use this data or search through it, we had to use the ```.find()``` algorithm to iterate over each object within the array searching for the matching ```id```
![SS6](./assets/SS6.png)
### JF 1.5 - Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software
- Throughout this project and many others I have worked on a team with other developers, this requires great communication and collaboration, through things like version control and also all coming together to agree on one idea
- There were many daily or weekly meetings set up with the team to check in and make sure progress was being made and that there were no blockers.
- We also set up a GitHub projects board where we managed tasks to make sure no duplicate work was being done
### JF 1.7 - Can follow company, team or client approaches to continuous integration, version and source control
- I have fully adopted the use of Git, GitHub, and GitHub Actions for version control and part of CI. 
- I know the best practices for cloning and working in a repo.  I have demonstrated how to create feature branches and open a pull request. 
- Within this project specifically and all other projects, GitHub has been used, and all work that i have done was done on a feature branch that went through the whole PR process. 
- I have also participated in code reviews for other PR's, created action/workflows in multiple projects both for American Express and through Multiverse
