## Inventory App

An full-stack inventory application using react and node

### Situation<br>
The goal of this application was to demonstrate my new knowledge for both front end and back end technologies. This project required good team collaboration and communication as well as further learning within the tech stack.

### Task
For this project, since it was full stack, I built out the [Server](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Inventory%20App%20Project/server) directory as well as the contributions to the [Public](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Inventory%20App%20Project/public) directory which houses the front end.

this app was made to have full CRUD operations on an item, and see those changes reflect immediately in the browser with react state management.

### Action
There were several areas in the repo that contributed, from creating [seed data](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Inventory%20App%20Project/server/seedData.js) to have test data to work with locally, to setting up the front end in [Public](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Inventory%20App%20Project/public) for users to interact with the data.

## Competencies
### JF 3.3 - Can link code to data sets
through fetching data from our server to display on our UI, I am properly demonstrating how to link code to data sets and use it.
after making a fetch request to the API, the response is checked for a status code, and acted upon accordingly. This allows us to better manage our data and to store it in a way that it can easily be shared throughout the app
