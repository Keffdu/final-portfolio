## Inventory App

An full-stack inventory application using react and node

### Situation<br>
The goal of this application was to demonstrate my new knowledge for both front end and back end technologies. This was a solo project so everything you see was built and designed by me.

### Task
For this project, since it was full stack, I built out the [Server](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Inventory%20App%20Project/server) directory as well as the 
![SS1](./assets/SS1.png)<br>
the dockerfile can be executed by first running the commands <br>
```yarn install```
```yarn tsc```
```yarn build:backend```
<br>
following those you can run ```yarn build-image``` which will get you running locally

### Action
There were several areas in the repo that contributed, and I ran into a lot of challenges during this project with trying to get everything configured locally to run properly, the hardest part was connecting github authentication and making sure it is passing the secrets correctly.
