# American Express Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2023-2025 apprenticeship at American Express. This includes a 3 month bootcamp where we learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node, version control, and fundamental programming concepts, followed by on-the-job learning. The 4 projects ive chosen show competency in each area of software development, as well as skills to collaborate with other developers and provide good documentation. All of this provides a great starting point for my career.

## Overview of Apprenticeship
- **Host Company**: American Express
- **Duration**: 15 Months 2023-2025

During my apprenticeship at Amex, I contributed value not only through improvements to my team's codebase but also by adding additional functionality. In this time, I assisted in implementing GitHub Actions to all our teams repos, as well as, add new components to the existing codebase, work on various user stories for accessibility, internationalization (translations), epics, production deployments, and bug fixes.

## Portfolio Introduction
- Who Am I?
    Hello, Im Kevin Dutzy, I am originally from Michigan but have relocated to Arizona as of 2023 to take a Software Engineering apprenticeship at American Express. Previously I worked in E-commerce but decided to make the transition into tech since ive always had an interest. I had some experience before the apprenticeship, I attended a bootcamp through Flatiron out of NY which provided a great starting point and network of people who were going through the same things I was. Outside of work i enjoy playing billiards, camping, hiking, thrifting, just about anything!
- Why you do what you do
    I love to problem solve, and I also am a very curious person who enjoys learning new things. So all of those qualities I think fit well for this type of work, and its rewarding once one are done building something or complete a big feature and get to see it being used.
- The teams you have worked on
    Ive gotten to work mainly with a team that does front end. I have gained a lot of knowledge and experience with React, and OneApp. Im looking forward to expanding my knowledge into the back end technologies at american express
