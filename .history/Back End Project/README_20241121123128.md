## Backend Project - Instrument App

An Instrument API containing catalog of instruments

### Situation<br>
The goal of this application is to connect workers at an instrument shop with to their catalog of instruments available to their customers. This API provides protected routes that can only be accessed through authentication/authorization to make sure only authorized users can access sensitive data. This application was intended to focus mainly on back end technologies and REST prinicples. 

### Task
The team wanted to design a straighforward API that was easy to work with, part of my tasks was to create the [model](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/models/Instrument.js), [seed data](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/seedData.js), [seed file](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/seed.js), [db](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/db.js), and some contributions to the routes. All of these files are housed in the [server folder](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/tree/main/Back%20End%20Project/server).

Our main focus was on the [routes](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/routes/instrument/instrument.js) and which should be protected, or what type of information the end user might find valuable. There was a lot of collaboration and brainstorming when going through the process of building our [routes](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/routes/instrument/instrument.js) as well as the [seed data](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/seedData.js) and how the object should be built.

### Action
There were several areas in the repo that contributed, I will go through my contributions to the routes, as well as the models files.
- #### [Routes](https://github.com/Keffdu/final-portfolio/blob/main/Back%20End%20Project/server/routes/instrument/instrument.js)
For our routes we decided we would want full CRUD operations on all instruments, requiring authorization for reading data.
here is an example for the standard ```/``` route that will return all instruments.

you can see ```requiresAuth()``` is running which we are importing from ```express-openid-connect```

after the user is authorized, we get all the instruments, decrypt the price and send the object as a response.

another route id like to touch on is the ```CREATE``` route

we built it so that there are validations done before the new instrument is created as well as encryption of the proce, and handles the errors if there are any. IF there are no errors,
