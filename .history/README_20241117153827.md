# American Express Apprenticeship Final Portfolio

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2023-2025 apprenticeship at American Express. This includes a 3 month bootcamp where we learned HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS, Node, version control, and fundamental programming concepts, followed by on-the-job learning. The 4 projects ive chosen show competency in each area of software development, as well as skills to collaborate with other developers and provide good documentation. All of this provides a great starting point for my career.
